# { Hello, friend! }

## About
{ Hello, Friend! } was a project submission for CERN Webfest 2020. The theme of the hackathon was collaboration, so we created an app to promote collaboration between programmers by allowing them to match with each other based on interests in projects.

## Post Submission (Project lead)
After the Webfest, I redid the project from scratch since I was not happy with some of the functionality. I switched to using ActionCable for live updates, and also implemented Devise account authentication, image uploads using Active Storage and Kramdown with Mathjax and Rouge for markdown in descriptions and messages.
